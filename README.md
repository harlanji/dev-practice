# dev-practice

Mostly self-contained demos in the theme of #100daysofcode.

## Status

As-is, not for production use.

Please pardon the inconsistent layouts over time and README format/quality.


## Direction

I have about 75 days of demos ready or nearly ready to be released,

And I spend some hours about 4-7 days per week making new demos

With various focus areas that I can note in a README for each demo.

I've come up with a brief plan for how to release one per day.

Time and resources permitting I will execute that plan.

As time goes on some cleanup may be done, but I lean toward keeping the layout stable over time;

Perhaps a symlink based logical organization can be done between the best layouts.
