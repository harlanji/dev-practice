# dev-practice

Mostly self-contained demos in the theme of #100daysofcode.

## Direction

I have about 75 days of demos ready or nearly ready to be released,

And I spend some hours about 4-7 days per week making new demos

With various focus areas that I can note in a README for each demo.

I've come up with a brief plan for how to release one per day.

Time and resources permitting I will execute that plan.
