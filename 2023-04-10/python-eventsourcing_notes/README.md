# Event Sourced Notes App Demo

Created an Event Sourced demo based on module documentation [1] [2].

In a later Dev Practice I look at serializing custom Entitiy types [3].

The project has very good documentation and the author seems to be responsive.

## Usage

Test with `python -m pytest test_notes_app_es.py`.

## Dev Practice

Focus:

* Learning Python Event Sourcing module
* Modeling a familiar domain (DDD)
* PyTest
